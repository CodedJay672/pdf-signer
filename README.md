# PDF Signer - Ritease Frontend Engineer Assessment

## Overview

This repository presents a comprehensive implementation of a PDF signing application, demonstrating expertise in modern frontend development practices and technologies. The project showcases a production-ready solution for handling PDF documents with robust annotation capabilities.

## Project Description

The application provides a seamless experience for users to manage PDF documents through a clean, intuitive interface. Built with Next.js and TypeScript, it leverages the powerful `pdftron` library from apryse to deliver reliable PDF manipulation capabilities.

## Core Functionality

### Document Management

- Secure PDF document upload system
- Drag-and-drop functionality
- Traditional file selection interface
- Real-time document preview

### Annotation Tools

- Text highlighting with customizable colors
- Text underlining with configurable styles
- Comment system tied to specific document locations
- Digital signature placement

### Export Capabilities

- High-quality PDF export preservation
- Embedded annotations and signatures
- Original document integrity maintenance

## Technical Specifications

- **Framework**: Next.js
- **Library**: pdftron from apryse
- **Architecture**: Single-page application (SPA)
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptive layout for various screen sizes
- **UI/UX**: Professional interface optimized for document manipulation

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Launch development server: `npm run dev`

## Development Journey

The most significant challenge encountered during development was PDF manipulation. Due to the complexity of PDF handling and limited available resources, we initially attempted implementation using PDF.js. After careful evaluation, we transitioned to pdftron from apryse, which provided more robust functionality while meeting project timeline constraints.

#### Library limitation

The pdfTron PDF library allows export of annotations and signatures in documents only for developers who have the commercial License key. This limits the last functionality which is for users to be able to export their file with the annotations.

## Future Enhancements

While pdftron handles core PDF operations effectively, there are opportunities for expansion:

- Implementation of live collaboration features
- Real-time document sharing capabilities
- Enhanced annotation tools
- Advanced signature management system

These improvements would transform the application into a comprehensive collaborative PDF workspace, similar to Figma's approach to document editing.
